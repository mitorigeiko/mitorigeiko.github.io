In essence this website just contains a list of YouTube videos which I have tagged and timestamped with the kata that are shown. As a bonus the grading points for the kata are listed below the videos.

Hopefully this will help you find examples quickly and without all the other distractions YouTube brings!


### Motivation
After getting feedback I didn't quite understand, I searched for some examples of that technique on YouTube. It took some trial and error, but I found a good recording and the feedback clicked into place! To be able to do the same more quickly in the future I started this project.
