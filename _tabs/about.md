In essence this website just contains a list of YouTube videos which have been tagged with the kata that are shown. And as a bonus the grading points for the kata are shown below the videos.

Hopefully this will help you find examples quickly and without all the other distractions YouTube brings!


### Backstory
After getting some feedback I didn't quite understand, I searched for some examples of that technique on YouTube. That took some translation and trial and error, but I found what I was looking for and the feedback clicked into place! To be able to do the same more quickly in the future I started this project.
